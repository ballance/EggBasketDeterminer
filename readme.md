My friend David Powers presented me with this problem via a Facebook post.  I decided to code up a solution to the problem below:

    "I walked to work today with a basket full of eggs. On the way I saw Chris Gadabout Ballance and gave him half the eggs in my basket plus half an egg. A bit later I ran into Jonathan von Breton and gave him half the eggs in my basket plus half an egg. Hey, I'm generous. Before I got to work I encountered Bob Leutner and gave him half the eggs in my basket plus half an egg. Wow, so many people in Charlotte! But still before I got to work I saw Jonathan Freirich, and since he wasn't feeling great last time I saw him, I gave him half the eggs in my basket plus half an egg. When I finally got to work, I ate the rest of the eggs for lunch, half the eggs in my basket plus half an egg, and now my basket was empty. Lousy meager lunch but much less cholesterol than planned. How many eggs did I start with?"
